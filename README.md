# DES-Implementation
DES i.e. Data Encryption Standard is a crptography algorithm based on symetric key block cipher.
Here is the source code for implementing DES.
As a user you just have to enter the plaintext you want to encrypt and as an output you'll get cipher key generated, cipher text generated and after decryption, the original plaintext recovered. Hope you like it. Contact me for any queries.
